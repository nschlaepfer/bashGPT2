# Fine-tuning Small GPT-2 for Bash Command Prediction with MLX

This project demonstrates how to fine-tune a small GPT-2 model to predict bash commands using Apple's MLX framework.

## Acknowledgements

A significant portion of the code in this project is based on the work from the [gpt2-mlx repository](https://github.com/dx-dtran/gpt2-mlx) by dx-dtran. We express our gratitude for their contributions to the MLX and GPT-2 community.

## Project Overview

This project aims to fine-tune a small GPT-2 model to predict bash commands. By leveraging the power of GPT-2 and the efficiency of Apple's MLX framework, we create a model that can understand and generate bash commands based on given prompts or contexts.

## Features

- Fine-tuning of small GPT-2 model
- Utilization of Apple's MLX framework for efficient training
- Bash command prediction capabilities

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- MLX framework
- Transformers library
- (Add any other specific libraries or dependencies)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```

   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

TBA

Example:
```
python train.py --data_path path/to/bash/commands/dataset --output_dir ./output
```

## Model Architecture

This project uses a small GPT-2 model architecture, which is a scaled-down version of the original GPT-2. It maintains the core principles of the transformer-based language model while being more suitable for fine-tuning tasks on specific domains like bash command prediction.

## Training Process

TBA

## Results

TBA

## Future Work

- Experiment with larger GPT-2 models
- Incorporate more diverse bash command datasets
- Implement interactive command prediction interface
